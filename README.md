## Overview

**Fizibu** is a social content platform themed application that combines social media and DEFI on a common ground. Fizibu is based on two main constituent:
• Content feed system that covers popular culture articles, lists, politics, animals, DIY, business and miscellaneous topics created by the Fizibu team and users. 
• A survey (survey) system that works similar to the governance system used in DEFI applications and offers a reward mechanism to the participants. 

The most important thing that distinguishes Fizibu from traditional social content platforms is that it provides users with a decentralized and profitable social media experience.

Users can read existing content, create content and conduct surveys, as in traditional social content platforms, as well as users earn **FZB** incentive rewards by taking advantage of the decentralized content feed system from the content they create and benefit from FZB-supported rewards by participating in surveys. *Content feed system incentive rewards will be implemented with Fizibu v2.0.

**Fizibu v1.0** is designed for the launch and adoption phase of the project.

## Voting Vault and Participation in Polls in v1.0

**Voting Vault** is the basis of the unique survey system offered by Fizibu. "Voting Vault", which works similar to the staking mechanism used for governance in DEFI applications, is created for users to participate in the surveys initiated and to determine the voting power they will have. **Voting Power** owned by users is determined by the amount of FZB which they stake in the Voting Vault. In order for fair surveys to take place, the staking upper limit in Voting Vault is limited to **5000 FZB**. The minimum stackable limit to the Voting Vault is 1 FZB. Users can participate in surveys on the Fizibu website after their Voting Powers are determined. Each user has one vote right for per survey and pay **5 FZB** as a contribution fee for participate in a survey. The paid contribution fees are collected in the Participation Fee Pool. FZB tokens collected in the **Participation Fee Pool** are distributed proportionally to their Voting Powers among those who voted for the option with the most votes when the survey is concluded.

Other changes that come with v2.0 are that **TX Fee** will begin to be received on FZB trades and 1% of voting rewards will be distributed to content creators.
